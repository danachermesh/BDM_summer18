    "Your task is to <b>compute the median age</b> of the Citibike’s <b>subscribed</b> customers, aka. usertype is \"Subscriber\". You are required to read data line by line and are not allowed to store the entire data set in memory. Indeed, you should not have any containers (e.g. list, dictionary, DataFrame, etc.) with more than a handful, e.g. strictly < 100, of elements in memory either as a local or a global variable. You can use the citibike.csv data file that we have on NYU Classes for testing, but we will evaluate your code on a much larger input to ensure it’s streaming capability.\n",
